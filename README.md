# JG-Oxfam
A page listing Oxfam's most recent donations from the JG API

## Setup

- To install npm dependencies:
```
npm install
```
- To run the server:
```
npm run start
```
- To run tests:
```
npm test
```

## What?
Create a web app to display the latest donations for a charity (Oxfam) using React and Node.js.

## Why?
To demonstrate my understanding of using React, Node and API calls. As well as for the following user stories:

**As an**... Oxfam employee <br>
**I want to**... be able to review recent donations <br>
**In order to**... monitor our account activity.

**As a**... prospective fundraiser <br>
**I want to**... get an impression of a charity's fundraising <br>
**In order to**... help me decide whether I want to raise money for them.

**As an**... Oxfam fundraiser <br>
**I want to**... see whether any of my fundraising gains recognition from Oxfam <br>
**In order to**... feel appreciated and further motivated.

## How?

- Deliver an MVP in 1 day
- Using node and hapi
- Tape testing
- CSS in keeping with the [JG site](https://www.justgiving.com/oxfam)
- Displaying data from the JG API
- Handlebars (or react - stretch goal)

## Time Constraints

1 day delivery for end result as first goal (if time, refactor). Second aim to use react.

## Next steps:

Learn react and then redo using react.
