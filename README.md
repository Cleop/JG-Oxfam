# JG-Oxfam
A page listing Oxfam's most recent donations from the JG API

## What?
Create a web app to display the latest donations for a charity (Oxfam) using React and Node.js.

## Why?
To demonstrate my understanding of using React, Node, TDD and API calls. As well as for the following user stories:

**As an**... Oxfam employee <br>
**I want to**... be able to review recent donations <br>
**In order to**... monitor our account activity.

**As a**... prospective fundraiser <br>
**I want to**... get an impression of a charity's fundraising <br>
**In order to**... help me decide whether I want to raise money for them.

**As an**... Oxfam fundraiser <br>
**I want to**... see whether any of my fundraising gains recognition from Oxfam <br>
**In order to**... feel appreciated and further motivated.

## How?

- Deliver an MVP in 1 day
- TDD
- Using node and hapi
- Tape testing
- CSS in keeping with the [JG site](https://www.justgiving.com/oxfam)
- Displaying data from the JG API

## Time Constraints

In the event that I do not complete the page in my allocated time limit I will document my proposed next steps for completing the project.
